## Introduction

Sign language is a visual language that uses hand shapes, facial expressions, gestures, and body language to convey meaning. This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate sign language detection system using MediaPipe.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Efficient and lightweight model
- Easy to integrate with various applications
- Supports custom sign language datasets

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devision789/Sign-Language-Detections-With-MediaPipe.git
cd sign-language-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the sign language detection application, execute the following command:

```bash
create yourdata : run scripts takephoto.py and then run script dataset.py to create data
```


## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be found [here](#). Make sure to download and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python dataset.py
```

This will start the training process using the dataset and configuration specified.

## Inference

To run inference on new data, use the following :
 run.py


## Results

The results of the detection will be displayed in real-time. You can also save the results by specifying the output directory in the configuration file.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
